Some common questions on getting !WebMyth up and running.  If you have a new question you can try submitting it as a comment to this page.

=== Q: Do I really need to install the script file? ===

A: Yes.  Currently the SDK provided by Palm does not allow for the direct telnet, MySQL and zeroconf services needed for this program.  WebOS 2.0 should fill that gap, but for now the script must be installed for !WebMyth to operate correctly

=== Q: The recordings and frontend searches are not working ===

A: First double check you installed the script file is installed on a local web server.  And that you changed the hardcoded to yoru specific system.  You can get the variables you need by looking at /etc/mythtv/mysql.txt on a functioning frontend or backend.  You can see if it is accessible by trying to view it from a web browser (i.e [http://my-server/cgi-bin/webmyth.py?op=getHosts]).  If your browser tries to download a file then that much is working.  If you get a 500 error from your browser you can try looking at the apache error log ("/var/log/apache2/error.log") for information.  

=== Q: !WebMyth can't seem to talk to a remote frontend even though I know it is a valid frontend ===

A: This might be an issue that the server where the script lives cannot resolve the frontend's system name.  You probably need to add it manually to the server's /etc/hosts file.

=== Q: I don't like the way the app looks, will it get better? ===

A: Hopefully.  I am not much of a programmer and even less of a designer to for the most part stuff just has to be good enough for me be OK with it.  If you have any design experience or even just some random idea feel free to email me or add a comment to this page.
