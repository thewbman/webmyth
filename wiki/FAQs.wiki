Some common questions on getting !WebMyth up and running.  If you have a new question you can try submitting it as a comment to this page.

=== Q1 - Do I really need to install the script files? ===

Yes.  Currently the SDK provided by Palm does not allow for the direct telnet, mysql and zeroconf services needed for this program.  WebOS 2.0 should fill that gap, but for now both scripts must be installed for WebMyth to operate correctly

=== Q2 - The recordings and frontend searches are not working ===

First double check you installed the script file is installed on a local webserver.  Although there won't be any data, you can see if it is accessible by trying to view it from a webbrowser (i.e [http://my-server/webmyth-mysql.php]).  If your browser tries to download a blank file then that much is working.  Double check that the MySQL server name and database details hard-coded into the file match your local configuration.  You can check out /etc/mythtv/mysql.txt on a working frontend or backend for the proper values.

=== Q3 - !WebMyth can't seem to talk to a remote frontend even though I know it is a valid frontend ===

This might be an issue that the server where the remote.py scripts lives cannot resolve the frontend's system name.  You can either add it manually to the server's /etc/hosts file or just use the frontend's IP address if you know it.
